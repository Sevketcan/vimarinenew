With stricter environmental regulations coming into force, the shipping industry is under pressure to reduce its carbon footprint. Electrical solutions are at the forefront of this green transition.

### Hybrid Power Systems
Hybrid systems that combine traditional engines with battery storage are proving to be a game-changer. They allow vessels to operate more efficiently, reducing fuel consumption and emissions.

### Shore Power Connectivity
Connecting to shore power while at port (cold ironing) eliminates emissions from auxiliary engines. We are seeing a surge in demand for retrofitting vessels with shore power connection systems.

### Energy Efficient Lighting and Motors
Simple upgrades like switching to LED lighting and high-efficiency motors can have a significant cumulative impact on a vessel's overall energy consumption.
