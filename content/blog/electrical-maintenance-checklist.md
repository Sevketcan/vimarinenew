Dry docking is a critical period for any vessel. It's the perfect opportunity to perform deep maintenance on electrical systems that is otherwise impossible while at sea.

### Main Switchboard Inspection
A thorough cleaning and tightening of connections in the main switchboard is essential using thermal imaging to detect hotspots.

### Generator Maintenance
Overhauling generators and testing their protection systems ensures reliability for the next sailing period.

### Emergency Systems Test
Testing emergency lighting, alarms, and backup power sources is non-negotiable for safety compliance.
